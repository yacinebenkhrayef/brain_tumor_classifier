# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classifier

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a deep learning solution for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans. It utilizes **Transfer Learning** (ResNet50) to classify images into four categories: **Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor**.

Beyond classification, this project focuses on **Explainable AI (XAI)** using **Grad-CAM** to visualize the regions of the brain driving the model's predictions, addressing ethical transparency requirements in medical AI.

The entire pipeline is deployed using a robust **MLOps** architecture involving Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, and MLflow.

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Dataset**  
Source: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset  
Preprocessing: Images resized to 224x224 and pixel values rescaled to [0, 1]. No data augmentation during validation/testing to ensure consistent metrics.

2. **Model Architecture: ResNet50**  
We employed Transfer Learning using the ResNet50 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet.  
- Phase 1 (Feature Extraction): Frozen backbone, trained only the custom top layers (Dense 512 -> Dropout -> Softmax).  
- Phase 2 (Fine-Tuning): Unfroze the top 30 layers of the backbone (approx. last 2 blocks) and retrained with a very low learning rate (1e-5) to adapt feature maps to MRI textures without catastrophic forgetting.

3. **Explainability (Grad-CAM)**  
To ensure the model is not "cheating" (e.g., looking at watermarks or bones), we implemented Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). This generates a heatmap overlay showing which pixels most influenced the prediction.
